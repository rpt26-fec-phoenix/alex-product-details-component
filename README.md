# AirBnB Clone by Team Phoenix

> Our team developed an AirBnB clone that mirrors the front end functionality of airbnb.com. This is our first attempt at SOA(service oriented archritecture), and we broke up the listing page into multiple services and worked on each independently. The other related portions of this clone will be found in the related projects section. 

> I was specifically in charge of the listing description and calendar service
